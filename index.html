            Software Engineer
          </h2>
          <p>
            After three years as an accountant at a Deaf-owned business, 
            I realized I wanted to make an impact a different way. After 
            deciding to transition to software engineering, I chose Holberton School 
            because of their proven track record of helping people change their careers 
            and because I felt their project-based model of education was a perfect fit for me. 
            I recently completed the year-long Foundations Curriculum at Holberton and am currently looking for 
            opportunities to contribute my Python backend skills to a socially conscious company committed to doing good.
            <br>
            <br>
            I am hoping to work with people who are as excited about food, reading, and bicycling as I am.
